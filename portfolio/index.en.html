<h2>Program complex "Ventilation of mines"</h2>

<p>
The program complex consists of several interacting programs.
In addition, the program VentSys provides the ability to store measurements and calculations in a single database (using Firebird, but you can use another SQL database).
</p>

<p>
System design and control of ventilation is intended for automation of ventilation calculations and monitoring of the composition and quantity of air in mine.
The system provides automation of all payment and accounting works, which are regulated by the Rules of security, various normative and methodological documents for the design and operation of coal mines.
<br/>
Main functions of the system design (calculation) ventilation:
<br/>
- calculation gas mountain development of the natural gas;
<br/>
- calculation gas mountain development of the actual gas; calculation of ventilation of blind development (with a choice of ventilators of local ventulation);
<br/>
- calculation of ventilation treatment areas, including schemes with removal of gas;
<br/>
- calculation of distribution of air in mine workings in normal and emergency modes.
<br/>
The main functions of the control system:
<br/>
- accounting measurements of air flow and concentration of methane.
<br/>
- accounting air samples;
<br/>
- accounting gas;
<br/>
- control of insulation jumpers and fire plots;
<br/>
- control of ventilation installations
<br/>
- import and data control system Mikon.
<br/>
The reporting functions of the system:
<br/>
- the establishment of the categories of mine gas;
<br/>
- formation of ventilation log (forms 1, 2, 3);
<br/>
- formation log on measurement and examinations;
<br/>
- formation of documents on the results of calculations;
<br/>
- maintain emergency response plan.
<br/>
Service functions of the system:
<br/>
- formation and maintenance of ventilation schemes;
<br/>
- unloading base for transmission to the inspecting organizations;
<br/>
- maintenance of normative documents on ventilation.
<br/>
Application of the system will provide:
<br/>
- correct and consistent use of all the methodological regulations of the various guidelines on the calculation of ventilation shafts;
<br/>
- increase the objectivity of the measurements of the composition and the air flow;
<br/>
- the necessary relationship between the measurements and calculations, the ability to automatically use the results of measurements, calculations;
<br/>
- easy and rapid transmission of results ventilation calculations and measurements of inspecting authorities.
